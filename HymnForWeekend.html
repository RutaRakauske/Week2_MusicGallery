    <h1>Hymn For Weekend</h1>
    <h3>Aprašymas</h3>
    <p>
        The song was debuted on Annie Mac's BBC radio show on 30 November 2015, and Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman dialed in 
        after the song aired to talk about his brush with royalty. According to Berryman, lead singer Chris Martin originally
        wanted the song to be a party song with the lyrics "drinks on me, drinks on me", but his bandmates didn't think that
        would go well with their fans. Martin's longtime friend Beyoncé was asked to sing on the song, and she accepted the 
        request. Martin corroborated Berryman's story about the band protesting him singing, "Drinks on me, drinks on me" in 
        an interview with The Wall Street Journal. According to Martin, the original kernel was that he "was listening to 
        FloRida or something", and he thought, "it's such a shame that Coldplay could never have one of those late-night club 
        songs, like "Turn Down for What". I thought I'd like to have a song called 'Drinks on Me' where you sit on the side of a 
        club and buy everyone drinks because you're so fucking cool," Martin recalled. "I was chuckling about that, when this
         melody came, 'drinks on me, drinks on me', then the rest of the song came out. I presented it to the rest of the band 
         and they said, 'We love this song, but there's no way you can sing "drinks on me."' So that changed into 'drink from me' 
         and the idea of having an angelic person in your life. Then that turned into asking Beyoncé to sing on it."
