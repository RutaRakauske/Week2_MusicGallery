    <h3>Aprašymas</h3>
    <p>
        "Fix You" was inspired by Martin's wish to continue helping Paltrow get through her grief. He wanted to base the song on a church organ; 
        instead he powered up a synthesizer given to Paltrow by her father, the instrument sitting unused in their house, to find "it had these 
        amazing sounds on it." Martin said that the song's composition is influenced by English alternative rock band Elbow's 2003 anthem 
        "Grace Under Pressure". In 2005, he described "Fix You" as "probably the most important song we've ever written".
        He wrote four other songs for or about Paltrow: "Moses" (2003), "Swallowed in the Sea" (2005), "Magic" and "Another's Arms" (2014).
        All of Coldplay helped in writing the song. During a track-by-track analysis, bassist Guy Berryman observed that "Fix You" 
        takes "a bit of inspiration" from "Many Rivers to Cross" by Jimmy Cliff (1969). Berryman added, "It becomes its own thing, 
        kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths. Whenever you want to write a song like someone else,
         it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway.".
