    <h1>Christmas Lights</h1>
    <h3>Aprašymas</h3>
    <p>
        The single's release date was announced through the official Coldplay website on 24 November 2010. A countdown in minutes 
        and seconds to 1 December 8pm GMT, appeared on the homepage of the website, accompanied by an animated GIF of the album art.
        Coldplay released three 'making-of' videos through their iTunes Ping page, showing the creation of the music video. Another 
        video was also released on their website, giving a preview of the music video and the song itself, plus more 'making-of' footage. 
        It was originally thought that "Christmas Lights" would be a song from the band's fifth studio album Mylo Xyloto, but this was 
        confirmed not to be the case by Coldplay's official fan-question answer system The Oracle on two occasions.
        For the week ending 18 December 2010, "Christmas Lights" both debuted and peaked at position number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 
        Hot 100 singles chart and position number 12 on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs chart. A live recording of the song was also 
        featured as the closer track on the band's Live from Spotify London EP, released exclusively on Spotify on December 2016. 
        A physical release of "Christmas Lights" was released on 4 December 2020, to mark the song's tenth anniversary. 
        It was made available in a limited-edition blue 7-inch vinyl with "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas as its B-side.
