    <h3>Aprašymas</h3>
    <p>
        "A Sky Full of Stars" marks the band's first dance track, being outlined as an EDM track with house influences.
        A piano-centric song which is written in the key of G♭ major, the track opens as a piano ballad, with progressive
         house-influenced electronic music that plays out in between verses. According to the sheet music published at 
         Musicnotes.com, the song follows a chord progression of with a tempo of 125 beats per minute,
          and the vocals span from A3 to G5. The track has been described as "[falling] in line with the synth-heavy 
         soundscapes of 'Midnight', but with more danceable flavor". The song's repeating chord sequence and varied melody 
         was inspired by the work of American pop singer Katy Perry and Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" (1991).
